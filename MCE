-- The Final-code
-- Table of contents:
-- All diamond items = 50$ each
-- All Gold items = 35$ each
-- All iron items = 20$ each
-- All cobblestone items = 15$ each
-- All wooden items- = 5$ each
-- Welcome, the following will be my submission for term 3, and I veru much ope that it works...
B = "minecraft:diamond"
C = "minecraft:gold_ingot"
D = "minecraft:iron_ingot"
-- The above shall be the only legitamate means to purchase the items of your chosing and below, I will showhow much each one is worth.
b = 50
c = 35
d = 15
-- Now, i will begin with the code which will permit the user to give an currency to the turtle and receive an item back.

-- in this function, you will be permitted to purchase any of the diamond items, for they are all worth the same...

      turtle.drop()
    else
     print("sorry pal, but it seems like you don't have a sufficient amount of funds.")

-- Next, i'm hoping to repeat the same process but with Gold, and Iron ingots.

-- And now, last but not least, Iron...
